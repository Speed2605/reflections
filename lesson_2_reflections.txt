it creates a git file
i need it to start tracking git files

in staging area you can add difirent files to commit together
you can have same starting point for two files

check git status 

if i want to try something new and keep the old version in difirent path

it makes it easier to understand which branch is where

we got an unique branch that has the same parent and all the changes in both branches

git shows us if there is a conflict happening
