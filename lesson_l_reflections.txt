it listed only things that were wrong
easier look
you can choose when you think it is a good point to commit
git allows multiple because they can be linked
google docs uses separately because it uses only one program at time
i can use git log to see all the logs that have been changed
i can use git diff to see what has changed between 2 commits
it makes me really confident when I can go back to previous state 
i want to code some sh*t
